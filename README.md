# Task Tracker CLI

A simple command-line Task Tracker built with **Node.js** using the **CommonJS** module system. This project demonstrates CRUD operations, file-based persistence using JSON, and a modular backend architecture without any external libraries.

---

## Features

* ✅ Add a new task
* ✅ Update an existing task
* ✅ Delete a task
* ✅ List all tasks
* ✅ List tasks by status
* ✅ Mark a task as:

  * `todo`

node -v
npm -v
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Move into the project

```bash
cd task-tracker/backend
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> This project uses only Node.js built-in modules, so no external packages are installed.

### 4. Run the CLI

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Available Commands

### Show Help

```bash
npm start help
```

---

### Add a Task

```bash
npm start add "Buy Milk"
```

---

### Update a Task

```bash
npm start update <id> "Buy Bread"
```

Example:

```bash
npm start update 1751726700000 "Buy Bread"
```

---

### Delete a Task

```bash
npm start delete <id>
```

Example:

```bash
npm start delete 1751726700000
```

---

### List All Tasks

```bash
npm start list
```

---

### List Tasks by Status

#### Todo

```bash
npm start list todo
```

#### In Progress

```bash
npm start list in-progress
```

#### Done

```

---

### Mark Task as Todo

```bash
npm start mark-todo <id>
```

---

## Task Model

Each task is stored in `db/tasks.json` using the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1751726700000,
  "description": "Buy Milk",
  "status": "todo",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-05T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-05T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
